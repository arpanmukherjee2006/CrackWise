It covers bond types (ionic, covalent, coordinate, metallic), Lewis structures and formal charge, VSEPR shapes and bond angles, hybridization, molecular orbital theory (MOT), bond parameters (length, strength, order), polarity and dipole moments, resonance, hydrogen bonding, lattice energy (Born–Haber), and qualitative rules like Fajans’ for covalent character. Mastery of these ideas helps predict geometry, stability, magnetism, and reactivity—core skills for JEE problems.",
